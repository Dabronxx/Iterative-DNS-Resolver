   The academic integrity pledge can be found on page 3 of
   the document found here: https://www.sandiego.edu/conduct/documents/HonorCode.pdf

3. The estimated number of hours spent working on the project.
		- Time spent partner 1 spent working alone: 20 hours
		- Time spent partner 2 spent working alone: 17 hours
		- Time spent working together: 14 hours


4. A list of missing features and/or known bugs. (Put "None if there aren't
   any.)
	Sometimes github.io and a few others will time out. I don't think that
	this is a bug with our system because i saw it in dig as well. Also it was
	hard to determine google.com etc ip address because it cycles, again I
	don't think this is our issue.

	In short, no bugs.

5. Did you submit on time? (If not, you will be charged one comp375 buck.)
	No, charge us a project buck

6. (Optional) Any feedback you with to give me relating the project (e.g. Was it
   interesting? How could it be improved?)
	For future projects we need more time to work due to everything being done
		remotely now.
